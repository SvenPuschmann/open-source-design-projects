# Open source design projects

A collection of open source projects that welcome design contributions. Many projects are open to design contributions but many are not set up to accommodate design contributions. Therefore, this collection only contains projects that are design-friendly.

I have yet to determine what a "design-friendly" project means but the bare minimum should be:
1. The project has a "design needed" label or something similar.
2. The project is actively labeling issues that need design input.

## Design-friendly projects

- [AppFlowy](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy) [`label:"needs design"`](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs+design%22) - An open-source alternative to Notion.
- [Cal.com](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com) [`label:"ðŸŽ¨ needs design" `](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%F0%9F%8E%A8+needs+design%22) - Scheduling infrastructure for absolutely everyone.
- [Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud) [`label:design`](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adesign) - A safe home for all your data.
- [Outline](https://github.com/outline/outline) - The fastest knowledge base for growing teams.

> Note: Some projects, such as Outline, do not have a "design needed" label but maintainer are fast to respond and open to design contributions :)
