# Open source design projects

A collection of open source projects that welcome design contributions. Many projects are open to design contributions but many are not set up to accommodate design contributions. Therefore, this collection only contains projects that are design-friendly.

I have yet to determine what a "design-friendly" project means but the bare minimum should be:
1. The project has a "design needed" label or something similar.
2. The project is actively labeling issues that need design input.

## Design-friendly projects

- [Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud) [`label:design`](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adesign)- An open source content collaboration platform.
- [AppFlowy](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy) [`label:"needs design"`](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs+design%22) - An open-source alternative to Notion.
